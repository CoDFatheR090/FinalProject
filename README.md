Echoes of the Fallen Gods 💀✨
A console-based RPG developed in C#, designed to introduce core game development concepts within a compelling dark fantasy setting. Inspired by the rich, enigmatic lore of titles like Elden Ring, this project focuses on delivering an immersive narrative coupled with turn-based combat and a unique "madness" mechanic.

📖 The Lore of Echoes of the Fallen Gods 📜
In a forgotten age, a cataclysmic war of divine proportions shattered the very fabric of existence. The gods, once revered and absolute, fell from grace, their colossal forms broken, their powers scattered, and their consciousness fragmented into the world. This celestial conflict left behind a desolate, scarred realm, perpetually haunted by the Echoes of the Fallen Gods. 👻

You are the Last Herald, a mysterious entity reawakened in this ruined land with fragmented memories and a profound, unsettling purpose. Your origin is as enigmatic as the world around you – are you a remnant of a bygone era, a cursed soul, or perhaps a nascent god yourself? 🤔

As you traverse the crumbling ruins and blighted landscapes, you will encounter the twisted legacies of the fallen Pantheon: their monstrous Fallen Lords, their despairing Prophets, and the very essence of their fractured divinity, capable of bestowing both power and encroaching madness. Your journey is not one of heroics, but of endurance, discovery, and a desperate search for truth amidst the whispers of cosmic horror. Will you mend the shattered divine order, or will you too succumb to the overwhelming madness of the echoes? 🌌
